# Designing Interactive Experiences

## Design Process

Employing an explicit iterative design (or problem solving) process when designing games and other interactive experiences. Iterative design processes are widely used and generally consist of a similar set of steps that are exeucted in sequence:

1. Understanding the design challenge or problem to be solved.
1. Gathering ideas (brainstorming).
1. Building a prototype.
1. Evaluating the prototype.

At any point in the process the team may recognize that the work in a previous step was incomplete and that it is necessary to return to a previous and complete that work before going forward. After evaluating the prototype the cycle will repeat or the product will be ready for release (or both).
